		Class structures for KFKDs, FDs, single-table,  multi-table datasets
		
	LogReg/
		LogRegDense.R
	NBayes/
		NBayes.R
	TANBayes/
		TANBayes.R
		
	Implementations of denormalized/factorized learning/scoring for logistic 
	regression with batch gradient descent, naive bayes, and tree-augmented naive 
	bayes models respectively. This is the core of Santoku's library and API.

	Sample programs to show the usage of Santoku's library and API. They compare
	the execution of denormalized/factorized learning/scoring for all three ML 
	models on four dense datasets: Expedia, Flights, Walmart, and Yelp.
	To run a file, simply type "R -f CannedExpediaDensetop5p.R" on the command
	line. The results, accuracy, and run times are printed to the screen.

	Code and screenshots for the Shiny-based demo of the Santoku GUI. 
	It is executable from an RStudio console (click "Run App" on ui.R) and 
	renders in a separate window or web browser. 
	Allows a user to select the model, dataset, and database dependencies using 
	GUI menus. When selecting the dataset from the drop-down menu, use the 
	versions with the "(R)" suffix for the LogReg model alone.
	*NOTE*: Wait for a minute when running the demo for the first time to allow 
	it to load all the datasets in to R data frames

	Code to generate synthetic data in R in order to demonstrate and compare the 
	performance of denormalized/factorized learning/scoring for LogReg and 
	NBayes for various data sizes. A sample run output is also provided; it was
	run on my laptop. A Python script for plotting the results and the plots 
	based on the sample run are also included.
